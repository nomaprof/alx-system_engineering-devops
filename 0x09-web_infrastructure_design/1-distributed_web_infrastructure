The web infrastructure that hosts foobar.com can be improved using two (2) servers and a load balancer. 
The load balancer enables an active-active setup that ensures that the two servers are running at all times.
Each of the servers each has a webserver, an application server, and a database. The load balancer shares the
incoming traffic between the two active servers.

The database of each server are mirrors of each other with one of the databases serving as the master and the
other database serving as the slave. At every moment in time, what is saved to the master database is replicated
automatically in the slave database.

The load balancer is also a server that runs a software designed specifically to enable traffic sharing. An example of such software is Haproxy.

This infrastructure is redundant and enables an escape from the single-point-of-failure problem but it is however,
not secure and does not enable active traffic monitoring.
