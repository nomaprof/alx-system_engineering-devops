The web infrastructure with a load balancer can be secured using a firewall. The firewall serves as a gatekeeper
to prevent unwanted and unauthorized traffic from getting to the servers. In the case of the two server one load
balancer in the active-active configuration, each sever is given its own firewall to ensure that unauthorized persons
do not gain access to the servers.

Another aspect of protection that can be implemented on the active-active web infrastructure arrangement is a secure
socket layer (SSL) certificate that encrypts all communcation between the server and clients thereby converting the 
traffic between the client and server into an HTTPS traffic.

The performances of all the servers can also be monitored using a monitoring client to ensure proactive handling of imminient
problems and detection of anomalies during the operation of the servers.

The SSL termination at the load balancer may prevent the back-end server from knowing the protocol service requested by the client. 
If only one database has write priviledge, issues may arise in the event that the write database becomes faulty. Implementing redunancy
on web infrastructures may also be very expensive.
