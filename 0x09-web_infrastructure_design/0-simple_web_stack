foobar.com is first registered with a domain name provider. The main domain (foobar.com) and its subdomains
like (www.foobar.com) are then made to point to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8). The webserver (NginX) is 
then installed on the server to serve up the application files (in form of web pages) whenever it is requested
over the internet. The application server works along with the webserver but specifically handles the business logic
needs of foobar.com. The webserver and the application server are both linked the the database server to be able to
track changes made by clients to various records and forms maintained at the website.

This type of web infrastructure is susceptible to single-point-of-failure problems due to its lack of redundancy. This
type of infrastructure make it impossible to aviod downtime whenever software is being updated. Another disadvantage of
this infrastructure is its inablility to scale when traffic becomes high.
